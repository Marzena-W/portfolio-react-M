# Description
> As part of my web development portfolio, I created a custom-built portfolio site using the  front-end JavaScript library, React. The site was built from scratch, with a focus on modular code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend.

Key features of my portfolio site include:
1. Responsive design.
2. Clean UI - with a focus on typography, whitespace, and intuitive navigation.
3. Customizable components - To make it easy to modify and add new content to my site, I used React's component-based architecture. This means that each part of the site is encapsulated in a reusable component that can be easily customized or replaced.

## Installation
To install the app, do the following:
1. Clone the repo with git clone Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. 
2. Install dependencies - Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and install the dependencies required by the app by running npm install in your terminal. Additonally install axios and bootstrap for React.
3. Run the app - Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run the app by running npm start in your terminal. This will start a development server that will run the app in your browser. 
4. Customize the app (optional) - If you want to customize the app, you can modify the code by opening the project in a code editor like Visual Studio Code.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
