# Description
> As part of my web development portfolio, I created a custom-built portfolio site using the  front-end JavaScript library, React. The site was built from scratch, with a focus on modular code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend.

Key features of my portfolio site include: 
1. Responsive design.
2. Clean UI - with a focus on typography, whitespace, and intuitive navigation.
3. Customizable components - To make it easy to modify and add new content to my site, I used React's component-based architecture. This means that each part of the site is encapsulated in a reusable component that can be easily customized or replaced.
